# Training Improvement Guide

## üìä Analysis of Previous Training Results

### Current Performance (ResNet18, Synthetic Data)
- **MAE**: 7.25¬∞ ‚ùå (Target: <3¬∞)
- **RMSE**: 10.26¬∞
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.442 ‚ùå (Target: >0.75)
- **Training**: Stopped at epoch 6/10
- **Issue**: Validation loss increased after epoch 1

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Learning Rate Too High (0.001)**
   - Caused validation loss to spike after initial improvement
   - Model overshot optimal parameters
   - **Fix**: Reduced to 0.0001 (10x lower)

2. **Small Model Capacity (ResNet18)**
   - Only 11M parameters
   - Limited ability to capture complex patterns
   - **Fix**: Upgraded to ResNet34 (21M) or ResNet50 (23M)

3. **Insufficient Data (497 synthetic images)**
   - Too few samples for robust learning
   - Synthetic data doesn't capture real-world complexity
   - **Fix**: Use real driving dataset (Udacity/Comma.ai)

4. **Short Training (6 epochs)**
   - Early stopping triggered too soon
   - Model didn't have time to converge properly
   - **Fix**: Increased to 50 epochs with patience of 15

5. **Suboptimal Optimizer (Adam)**
   - Standard Adam doesn't handle weight decay well
   - **Fix**: Switched to AdamW for better regularization

6. **Aggressive Early Stopping (5 epochs)**
   - Stopped training before exploring better solutions
   - **Fix**: Increased patience to 15 epochs

## üîç Monitoring Training

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Training Loss**
   - Should decrease smoothly
   - No sudden spikes (if spikes, LR too high)
   - Typical: 0.3 ‚Üí 0.1 over training

2. **Validation Loss**
   - Should track training loss closely
   - Gap < 0.05 is good
   - Gap > 0.1 indicates overfitting

3. **Learning Rate**
   - Should show warmup (first 3 epochs)
   - Then smooth decrease (cosine)
   - Final LR ~1e-6

4. **Epochs Without Improvement**
   - Should reset when val loss improves
   - If consistently high, may need to:
     - Increase model capacity
     - Add more data
     - Adjust hyperparameters

### TensorBoard Tips
```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs --port 6006

# Open browser: http://localhost:6006

# Check these tabs:
# - SCALARS: Loss curves, LR schedule
# - DISTRIBUTIONS: Weight/gradient distributions
# - IMAGES: Sample predictions (if enabled)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Problem: Loss Not Decreasing
**Causes**:
- Learning rate too low
- Model too small
- Insufficient training time

**Solutions**:
1. Increase learning rate to 0.0003
2. Use ResNet50 instead of ResNet34
3. Train for more epochs
4. Check data quality

### Problem: Validation Loss Increasing
**Causes**:
- Overfitting
- Learning rate too high
- Poor data augmentation

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce learning rate to 0.00005
2. Increase weight_decay to 0.05
3. Add more augmentation
4. Use dropout (already in model)

### Problem: Training Too Slow
**Causes**:
- CPU training
- Large batch size
- Too many workers

**Solutions**:
1. Use GPU: `--device cuda`
2. Enable AMP: `use_amp: true`
3. Reduce batch_size if OOM
4. Adjust num_workers

### Problem: Model Predictions All Similar
**Causes**:
- Imbalanced dataset
- Model collapsed to mean
- Learning rate too high initially

**Solutions**:
1. Balance dataset (equal left/right/straight)
2. Check data distribution
3. Use warmup: `warmup_epochs: 5`
4. Try different initialization

## üìö Additional Optimization Strategies

### 1. Progressive Unfreezing
```python
# Train in stages
# Stage 1: Freeze backbone, train head only (5 epochs)
freeze_backbone: true

# Stage 2: Unfreeze last few layers (10 epochs)
freeze_backbone: false
freeze_layers: 5

# Stage 3: Full fine-tuning (35 epochs)
freeze_layers: 0
```

### 2. Cyclical Learning Rates
```yaml
# Try OneCycleLR for faster convergence
scheduler: "onecycle"  # Would need implementation
```

### 3. Data-Centric Improvements
- **Collect more data**: Aim for 10,000+ images
- **Balance classes**: Equal left/right/straight samples
- **Clean outliers**: Remove corrupted or mislabeled data
- **Add temporal context**: Use sequences of frames

### 4. Advanced Augmentations
- Random shadows and lighting
- Simulate different weather
- Add slight blur/noise
- Perspective transforms
