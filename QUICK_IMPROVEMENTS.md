## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Use Improved Config (Recommended)
```bash
python train.py --config config_improved.yaml --device cuda
tensorboard --logdir logs
```

### Option 2: Update Current Config
Edit `config.yaml` and change these lines:
```yaml
# Line 17: Change model
name: "resnet50"  # was resnet18

# Line 26: Change learning rate
learning_rate: 0.0001  # was 0.001

# Line 27: Change optimizer
optimizer: "adamw"  # was "adam"

# Line 28: Change scheduler
scheduler: "cosine"  # was "reduce_on_plateau"

# Line 29: Increase weight decay
weight_decay: 0.01  # was 0.0001

# Line 30: Increase patience
early_stopping_patience: 15  # was 10

# Add after line 31:
warmup_epochs: 3
use_amp: false  # Set true if using GPU
```

## 🎯 Priority Fixes

### Must Do (Critical)
1. ✅ **Lower learning rate** to 0.0001
2. ✅ **Add warmup** (3 epochs)
3. ✅ **Switch to AdamW** optimizer

4. ✅ **Upgrade to ResNet50** (or at least ResNet34)
5. ✅ **Increase early stopping patience** to 15
6. ✅ **Use Cosine scheduler**

### Nice to Have (Beneficial)
7. ✅ **Add mixed precision** (if GPU)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If training is too slow
```yaml
# CPU Config
model:
  name: "resnet34"  # Not resnet50
data:
  batch_size: 16    # Smaller batches
```

### If out of memory (GPU)
```yaml
data:
  batch_size: 16    # Reduce from 32
```

### If underfitting (loss not decreasing)
```yaml
training:
  learning_rate: 0.0003  # Increase slightly
model:
  name: "resnet50"       # Larger model
```

### If overfitting (val loss increasing)
```yaml
training:
  weight_decay: 0.05     # More regularization
augmentation:
  brightness: 0.4        # More augmentation
  rotation: 15
```

## 📈 Track Your Progress

Create a simple log:
```bash
# Before training
echo "Training started: $(date)" >> training_log.txt
echo "Config: config_improved.yaml" >> training_log.txt

# After training
echo "Best MAE: $(grep MAE evaluation_results/metrics.txt)" >> training_log.txt
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always monitor with TensorBoard** - catches issues early
2. **Save configs with timestamps** - easy to compare later
3. **Keep best model** - checkpoint_best.pth is your friend
4. **Log everything** - helps debug issues
5. **Start with small experiments** - 10 epochs first, then full training

---

## 🎓 What You Learned

1. **Learning rate is critical** - Too high = unstable, too low = slow
2. **Model size matters** - Bigger (within reason) = better
3. **Warmup is important** - Prevents early instability
4. **Patience pays off** - Don't stop too early
5. **Monitoring is essential** - TensorBoard shows problems
